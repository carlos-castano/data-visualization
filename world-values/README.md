# World Values Distribution

This project is an interactive data visualization designed around a single, central question: **How are values distributed worldwide?**

It is built following data visualization best practices, where the primary goal is to provide a clear, intuitive answer at first glance, while also offering the depth required for users to explore the nuances of the data on their own.

## ✨ Features & Design Philosophy

This project's design is guided by two core principles:

1.  **Clarity First: An Intuitive Overview**
   
    The first visualization is a composite chart that provides an immediate and intuitive answer to the main question. It combines:
    *   A minimally interactive **Chart.js donut chart** showing the proportional breakdown of the world population by ideological quadrant.
    *   A nested, interactive **Plotly bar chart** that provides a broad overview of the values for each region.

2.  **Depth on Demand: Avoiding Reductionism**

    A single chart can be reductionist. To counteract this, the second part of the page is a fully interactive **Tableau dashboard**. This element empowers the user to move beyond the summary and explore the data freely, filtering by country and examining the specific scores on the "Traditional-Secular" and "Survival-Self-expression" axes.
